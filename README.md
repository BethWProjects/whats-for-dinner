## Features
- Any of the radio buttons chosen will output a random item from that array.
- The Choose Your Own Adventure I chose was the Clear Button functionality.  When a user selects a food type, they can click through options, or click the Clear Button to close out the suggested option shown. This will hide/show a crockpot image on the second card shown on the page.
## Deployed Page
Visit my Whats for Dinner site here! [here](https://bethwprojects.github.io/whats-for-dinner/)
## Possible Future Extensions
  - A login page would be great for the user to save recipes.
  - Adding a favorites page with recipe instructions would be nice.
